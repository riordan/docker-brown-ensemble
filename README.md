Dockerfile for Storycollab (aka Ensemble)
=========================================
Docker image to set up a [Stanford HCI story-collab](https://github.com/StanfordHCI/story-collab) system.

# WARNINGS
There is lots of wet paint and broken code. Do not trust me.

This is designed to be used in a standalone context, and is not set to use an external database. That is stupid. Do not trust it.
